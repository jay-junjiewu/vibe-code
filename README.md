# Vibe Kode

Welcome to **[Vibe Kode](https://vibe-kode.vercel.app/)**, a fun and quirky web experience that flips the usual process of generating front-end elements on its head! Our project is dedicated to the recent trend of "Vibe Coding", where AI creates software entirely without the user checking the output beforehand.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
The concept is simple, yet playful:  
- Users send a request for a specific front-end UI element.
- We deliver the **exact opposite** of what you asked for.

Whether you want:
- A neatly styled button? We‚Äôll give you a messy, off-center one.
- A clean, minimalist form? You‚Äôll get an overly complex, cluttered design.
- A smooth, responsive layout? We‚Äôll throw in something intentionally unresponsive and chaotic.
